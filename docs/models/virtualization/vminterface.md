## Interfaces

Virtual machine interfaces are similar to device interfaces, but lack properties pertaining to physical attributes. For example, VM interfaces do not have a physical type and cannot have cables attached to them. However, they can have IP address and VLANs (both tagged and untagged) associated with them, just as device interfaces do.
