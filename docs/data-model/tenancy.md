NetBox supports the concept of individual tenants within its parent organization. Typically, these are used to represent individual customers or internal departments.

# Tenants

A tenant represents a discrete organization. Certain resources within NetBox can be assigned to a tenant. This makes it very convenient to track which resources are assigned to which customers, for instance.

### Tenant Groups

Tenants are grouped by type. For instance, you might create one group called "Customers" and one called "Acquisitions."
